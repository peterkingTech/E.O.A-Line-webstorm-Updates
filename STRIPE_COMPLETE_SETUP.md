# ESSENCE OF ARMOR - Complete Stripe Setup Guide

## Overview
This guide will help you set up your Stripe account with all products, SKUs, descriptions, and Bible verses ready for sales.

## Prerequisites

1. **Stripe Account**: Create a free account at https://dashboard.stripe.com/register
2. **API Keys**: You'll need your Secret Key from the Stripe Dashboard

---

## Step 1: Get Your Stripe Secret Key

1. Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
2. Click on "Reveal test key" or "Reveal live key" (depending on your mode)
3. Copy your **Secret Key** (starts with `sk_test_` or `sk_live_`)
4. Add it to your `.env` file:
   ```
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_secret_key_here
   ```

---

## Step 2: Run the Product Creation Script

The script will create all 11 products with:
- Complete descriptions
- Bible verses
- SKUs for inventory tracking
- Product images
- Color and size metadata
- Pricing in USD

Run the following command:

```bash
npm run create-stripe-products
```

This will:
- Create all products in your Stripe account
- Generate Price IDs for each product
- Display a summary of all created products
- Provide the STRIPE_PRICES mapping to copy

---

## Step 3: Copy the STRIPE_PRICES Mapping

After the script completes, you'll see output like:

```javascript
export const STRIPE_PRICES = {
  'LV-JK-F': 'price_xxxxxxxxxxxxx',
  'LV-JK-M': 'price_xxxxxxxxxxxxx',
  // ... more mappings
};
```

Copy this entire mapping and paste it into `src/lib/stripe.ts` replacing the existing STRIPE_PRICES object.
