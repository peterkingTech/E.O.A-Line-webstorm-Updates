# Admin Panel Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up and access the admin panel for your clothing store.

## Prerequisites

1. Supabase account and project set up
2. Environment variables configured in `.env` file

## Database Setup

### 1. Apply Migrations

The following migrations need to be applied in order:

2. `20251017112000_storage_bucket.sql` - Sets up storage bucket for product images

### 2. Create Your First Admin User

After applying migrations, you need to create an admin user in Supabase:

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to Authentication > Users
3. Click "Add User" and create a new user with email and password
4. Copy the user's UUID
5. Go to Table Editor > admin_users
6. Click "Insert row" and add:
   - `id`: Paste the user's UUID
   - `email`: The admin's email
   - `full_name`: Admin's full name (optional)
   - `role`: "admin"
